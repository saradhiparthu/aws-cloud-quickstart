AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive and widely adopted cloud computing platform offered by Amazon. It provides a broad set of on-demand services such as computing power, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning, IoT, security, and more. 

AWS services can be created and managed in several ways, each catering to different needs, preferences, and levels of expertise.

	1)AWS-Console 		 : A web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for managing AWS services.
	2)AWS-SDK 	  		 : SDKs for various programming languages.e.g., Boto3 for Python, AWS SDK for Java 2.x, AWS SDK for JavaScript.
	3)AWS-CLI 	  		 : The  AWS  Command  Line  Interface is a unified tool to manage your AWS services.
	4)AWS CloudFormation : AWS CloudFormation is a service that allows you to define and manage your AWS infrastructure as code (IaC). It enables you to create, update, and delete AWS resources in an automated, consistent, and repeatable manner using declarative templates written in JSON or YAML.
	5)AWS CDK            : A higher-level abstraction over CloudFormation, allowing developers to use familiar programming languages to define infrastructure.
	                       Supports languages like TypeScript, Python, Java, and C#.
	6)Third-Party Tools  : Suitable for users who want to use external tools for orchestration, IaC, or CI/CD. 
							Terraform, Ansible, Pulumi, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions.
